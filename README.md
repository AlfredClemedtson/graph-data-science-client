# gdsclient

**NOTE:** This is a work in progress and many GDS features are known to be missing or not working properly.

This repo hosts the sources for `gdsclient`, a Python wrapper API for operating and working with the [Neo4j Graph Data Science (GDS) library](https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science).
gdsclient enables users to write pure Python code to project graphs, run algorithms, and define and use machine learning pipelines in GDS.
The API is designed to mimic the GDS Cypher procedure API, but in Python code.
It abstracts the necessary operation of the Neo4j Python Driver to offer a simpler surface.

Please leave any feedback as issues on this repository.
Happy coding!


## Installation

To build and install `gdsclient` from this repository, simply run the following command:

```bash
pip install .
```


## Documentation

A minimal example of using `gdsclient` to connect to a Neo4j database and run GDS algorithms:

```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
from gdsclient import Neo4jQueryRunner, GraphDataScience

# Set up driver and gds module
URI = "bolt://localhost:7687"  # Override according to your setup
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(URI)  # You might also have auth set up in your db
gds = GraphDataScience(Neo4jQueryRunner(driver))
gds.set_database("my-db")  # Not using the default database

# Project your graph
G = gds.graph.project("graph", "*", "*")

# Run the PageRank algorithm with custom configuration
gds.pageRank.write(G, tolerance=0.5, writeProperty="pagerank")
```

For extensive documentation of all operations supported by GDS, please refer to the [GDS Manual](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/).

Extensive end-to-end examples in Jupyter ready-to-run notebooks can be found in the `examples` directory:

* [Computing similarities with KNN based on FastRP embeddings](examples/fastrp-and-knn.ipynb)


## Testing

Tests can be found in `gdsclient/tests`. In each of the folders there, `unit` and `integration`, the tests of that respective type reside.

To install the Python requirements for running tests simply run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```


### Unit testing

The unit tests are run without a connection a database. Typically the `CollectingQueryRunner` is used to mock running queries.
To run the unit tests, simply call:

```bash
pytest gdsclient/tests/unit
```


### Integration testing

In order to run the integration tests one must have a [Neo4j DBMS](https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/current/) with the Neo4j Graph Data Science library installed running.

The tests will through the [Neo4j Python driver](https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/) connect to a Neo4j DBMS based on the environment variables:

* `NEO4J_URI` (defaulting to "bolt://localhost:7687" if unset),
* `NEO4J_USER`,
* `NEO4J_PASSWORD` (defaulting to "neo4j" if unset).

However, if `NEO4J_USER` is not set the tests will try to connect without authentication.

Once the driver connects successfully to the Neo4j DBMS the tests will go on to execute against the DBMS's default database.

The command for running the integration tests is the following:

```bash
pytest gdsclient/tests/integration
```


## Style guide

The code follows a rather opinionated style based on [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

To enforce code style we use several tools, and they can all be installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
```

### Linting

To enforce pep8 conformity (with the exception of using max line length = 120) [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is used.
To run it on the entire repository, simply call:

```bash
flake8
```

from the root. See `.flake8` for our custom flake8 settings.


### Formatting

For general formatting we use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with default settings.
black can be run on the entire repository by calling:

```bash
black .
```

from the root.

Additionally [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) (also with default settings) is used for consistent import sorting.
It can similarly be run over all source code by calling:

```bash
isort .
```

from the root.


### Static typing

The code is annotated with type hints in order to provide documentation and allow for static type analysis with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/).
Please note that the `typing` library is used for annotation types in order to stay compatible with Python versions < 3.9.
To run static analysis on the entire repository with mypy, just run:

```bash
mypy .
```

from the root. See `mypy.ini` for our custom mypy settings.
