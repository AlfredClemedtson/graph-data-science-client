    "The way to do this currently in Aura is to copy the database over to an AuraDS instance.\n",

    "It also has another couple of limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's very manual; users have to click in the Aura Console to copy the database\n",
    "- Once GDS computations are finished, writing back to the AuraDB instance is also a manual configuration\n",
    "- AuraDS instances have to be manually managed in the Aura Console and do not encourage users to delete them after usage, thus causing increased running costs\n",
