# Changes in 1.0.0


## Breaking changes

* NC and LP training pipelines are no longer `Model` objects.
* Removed support for GDS 1.x `graph.create` syntax.
* Replace NC and LP training pipelines method `configureParams` by new methods `addLogisticRegression` and `addRandomForest`.
* Removed support for GDS 1.x `gds.alpha.similarity.*` functions and procedures.
* Replace all dict return types with pandas Series.
* Replace all list[dict,...] return types with pandas DataFrame.


## New features

* All procedures of the GDS Pipeline catalog are supported.
* The `TrainingPipeline` object inherited by NC and LP training pipelines have new methods corresponding to the procedures of the pipeline catalog.
* The NC and LP training pipelines support estimating `train` via a `train_estimate` method.
* All ML models support estimating `predict` via `predict_[mode]_estimate` methods.


## Bug fixes

* Automatically `close` the Neo4j driver instantiated in the default constructor of the `GraphDataScience` object when all references to the driver have been dropped.
