= Known limitations

Operations known to not work with the Python client are:

* https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/utility-functions/#utility-functions-numeric[Numeric utility functions] (will never be supported)
* https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/graph-creation/[Cypher on GDS] (might be supported in the future)

The GDS Python client is not compatible with Python's `multiprocessing` or any operations that rely on forking. If running queries in parallel is required, multithreading can be used instead.
