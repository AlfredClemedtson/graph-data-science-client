= Coordinate parallel transactions

Bookmarks ensure that when executing queries in a Neo4j cluster, previous or parallel running queries are fully propagated through the cluster.
By passing one or multiple bookmarks along with a query, the server will make sure that the query does not get executed before the represented state(s) have been established.

.Example of using bookmarks with GDS
[source, python]
----
# If you ran queries through Neo4j driver before you can pass bookmarks in the constructor
gds = GraphDataScience(NEO4J_URI, auth=(NEO4J_USER, NEO4J_PASSWORD), bookmarks=None)

gds.run_cypher("""
    CREATE (:Person {name: "Alice"})-[:KNOWS]->(:Person {name: "Bob"})
""")

# Make sure the next queries will be executed after the CREATE query is fully propagated through the cluster
gds.set_bookmarks(gds.last_bookmarks())

G, _ = gds.graph.project("myGraph", "Person", "KNOWS")

gds.pageRank.write(G, writeProperty="pagerank")

# Make sure the next queries will be executed after the pageRank scores were written back to the cluster
gds.set_bookmarks(gds.last_bookmarks())

result = gds.run_cypher("MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p.name, p.pagerank")

G.drop()
