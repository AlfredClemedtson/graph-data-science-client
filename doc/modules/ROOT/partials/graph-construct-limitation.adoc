=== Limitations on community edition

For users of GDS community edition, performance can be impacted for large graphs.
It is possible that socket connection with the database times out.
If this happens, a possible workaround is to modify the server configuration https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/configuration-settings/#config_server.bolt.connection_keep_alive[`server.bolt.connection_keep_alive`]
or https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/configuration/configuration-settings/#config_server.bolt.connection_keep_alive_probes[`server.bolt.connection_keep_alive_probes`].
However, be aware of the side effects such as a genuine connection issue now taking longer to be detected.
