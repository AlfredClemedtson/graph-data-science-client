= Building GDS client ref docs with sphinx

Doc sources exist in code source files.
Edit it there.

To build the html content, do this:

1. Set working directory to the root of this repository.
2. Install sphinx into your venv: `pip install sphinx`
3. Run `./scripts/render_api_docs`
4. Go to `localhost:8000` in your web browser.

In order to make changes, iterate on steps 3-5 above.

Adding new content sections is done by editing the `doc/sphinx/source/index.rst` file.
Configure stuff in `doc/sphinx/source/conf.py`.

Add more or edit content in this file when you learn something new.
